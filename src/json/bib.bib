abstract = "In the present paper we have conducted studies on seismological properties using worldwide data of deep earthquakes (depth larger than 70 km), considering events with magnitude greater than or equal to 4.5. This work is an extension of a previous study using a similar approach, for shallow events. We have addressed the problem under the perspective of complex networks, using a time window model to build the networks for deep earthquakes. These networks present scale-free and small-world features, contributing to strengthen the use of the time window model to construct epicenters networks. The results for deep events were analyzed using Nonextensive Statistical Mechanics and they corroborate with those found for the shallow ones, since the connectivity distribution for deep earthquakes also follows a q-exponential distribution and the scaling behavior is present. Our findings reinforce the idea of long-range correlations between earthquakes and the criticality of the seismological system."

abstract = {In this paper, a European black Japanned piece of furniture (dated to approximately 1860) was analyzed by XRF, Raman spectroscopy and FT-IR techniques. The analyses detected pigments such as vermilion/cinnabar [HgS], Massicot [PbO], lamp black [C] and green earth [K[(Al,FeIII),(FeII,Mg)](AlSi3,Si4)O10(OH)2], which were possibly dissolved in gum arabic. The analyses also determined that the metallic ornaments consist of a brass alloy with traces of gold and that gold was also used in some golden regions of the polychrome. The results obtained assisted restorers in choosing suitable intervening procedures and contributed to a better understanding of the cupboard manufacturing process.},

	abstract = {In this paper, nine beads from excavations in the Valongo Wharf, located in the harbor area of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil that were utilized as ornaments by Africans and Afrodescendants during the 19th century were analyzed by Raman and X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy. All samples in the analysis showed Raman spectra with two bands of maximum intensity around 1000 and 500 cm?1 related to the maximum stretching (?max) and bending mode (?), respectively, of the tetrahedral network of the SiO4 present in the glass matrix. However, there is variation in the intensity and position of the bands that are directly associated with the burning process and the raw material utilized in the manufacture of the beads. Based on the polymerization index (Ip = A500/A1000), it is possible to relate these two parameters. By establishing a correlation among the Ip and the ?max band, the beads were classified into groups. The results reveal that the beads’ base paste exhibits differences, allowing their classification into groups according to the manufacturing process. Based on the combination of the elemental characterization and Raman spectroscopy results, it was also possible to conclude that European and Asian countries are the possible origins of the beads.}

abstract = "In this work, 960 réis coins from the period when Brazil was a colony of Portugal were analyzed using the x-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometry. The history of these coins, dated between the end of the 17th century and the beginning of the 19th century, had a great influence on the immigration of the Portuguese Prince Regent D. João to Brazil, who arrived in 1808. Bearing in mind the need to expand the timid Brazilian monetary system, the Portuguese crown decided to collect Spanish silver pesos of 8 reales, recoined with a value of 960 réis. The recoinage procedure was carried out using a stamp; therefore, in many cases, it is possible to check the base currency. In this work, were investigated 17 samples of 960 réis coins by XRF, in which the base coin was 8 reales manufactured with raw materials from Mexican mines. In addition to characterizing the elemental composition of the coins, the XRF data were evaluated using multivariate statistical method of Robust Principal Component Analysis (ROBPCA), which was used to classify the coins based on their elemental composition. However, with XRF, elementary information is obtained for a depth of only a few micrometers. One of the essential issues in Ag–Cu metal alloys is the Ag enrichment, which can cause changes to the elemental composition of the surface. Therefore, initially, a study was carried out to verify whether the surface compositions of the coins were altered by the Ag enrichment."
